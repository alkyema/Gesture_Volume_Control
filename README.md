Volume Control Using Hand Gesture
Description
This project implements a sophisticated volume control system that uses hand gestures as input. By leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning, the system detects specific hand gestures to increase, decrease, or mute the volume on your device. This hands-free approach to volume control is not only innovative but also adds a futuristic touch to everyday interactions with technology.

Features
Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets predefined hand gestures using a webcam.
Volume Adjustment: Increases, decreases, or mutes the volume based on recognized gestures.
Real-Time Processing: Provides real-time feedback and volume adjustment with minimal latency.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for ease of use.
Technologies Used
OpenCV: For real-time computer vision tasks.
Mediapipe: For robust hand tracking and gesture recognition.
Python: The primary programming language for implementation.
PyAutoGUI: For controlling system volume.
